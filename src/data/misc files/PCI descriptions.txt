"Render PAN unreadable anywhere it is stored (including on portable digital media, backup media, and in logs) by using any of the following approaches: • One-way hashes based on strong cryptography, (hash must be of the entire PAN) • Truncation (hashing cannot be used to replace the truncated segment of PAN) • Index tokens and pads (pads must be securely stored) • Strong cryptography with associated key-management processes and procedures."
"If disk encryption is used (rather than file- or column-level database encryption), logical access must be managed separately and independently of native operating system authentication and access control mechanisms (for example, by not using local user account databases or general network login credentials).
